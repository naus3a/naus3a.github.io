<p><strong>where: </strong> <a href="http://maps.google.it/maps?q=Museo+della+Scienza+e+della+Tecnologia+Leonardo+da+Vinci,+Via+San+Vittore,+Milan&#038;hl=it&#038;sll=41.442726,12.392578&#038;sspn=16.749658,39.023438&#038;vpsrc=0&#038;t=h&#038;z=14" target="new">Milano</a></p>
<p><strong>when: </strong> from 20th september 2011 to 20th november 2011</p>
<p><strong>what: </strong><i>Democratizing Technology</i> is an exhibit sponsored by Ford and aimed at making new car embedded <i>intelligent systems</i> easily understandable, through a series of hands-on experiences.<br />
I was responsible to create two interactive installations that could educate kids (and grown ups) in a playful way.<br />
The first one tries to show in the simplest possible way how a computer can parse vocal commands.<br />Visitors can visualize the sound spectrum of different commands, pass their data buffer to the sound card and hear their sound.<br />Then they are asked to repeat the word they heard and, while their voice gets recorded, they can visualize in real time the &#8220;shape&#8221; of their voice.<br />Visitors are asked to visually compare the &#8220;shapes&#8221; of the two different sounds and look for similarities and differences; finally the software explains how specialized techniques can be used to efficiently automate this kind of comparison.<br />
The second one gives an explanation of how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_sign_recognition" target="new">traffic sign recognition</a> systems work.<br />Visitors are asked to imagine and draw their own traffic sign on a blank sticker and to place their creation under a camera.<br />The software takes a snapshot of the drawing, applies a set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction" target="new">feature extraction</a> techniques and visualizes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_point_detection" target="new">interest points</a> it finds (ie: edges, corners, gradients and their relative distribution inside the image). As Visitors begin to understand how these detected features &#8220;describe&#8221; the image they have just created, they are asked to give a name to the &#8220;traffic sign&#8221; they created and to challenge the computer vision software: they are asked to move, rotate, partially hide their sticker, while the software continues to track it and recognize it.<br />Finally, visitors are asked to choose one of the available backgrounds depicting different scenarios (urban, seaside, desert, etc) and to glue their sticker on it: just like in real world scenarios, the software still finds and recognizes the drawing, even between all the other elements in the picture.</p>

<p><strong>what else: </strong>given the name of the exhibit, it was a natural choice to use only open source libraries; if somebody is curious to look under the hood, the traffic sign recognition software is licensed <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License" target="new">GPL</a> and its source code is <a href="http://www.augmentedrealityag.com/src/democratizing_tech_signrecog.zip">here</a>.</p>

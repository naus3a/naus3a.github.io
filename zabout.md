My name is Enrico Viola and I lead [A/R/T[generative boutique]](http://augmentedrealityag.com).

I’m both a coder and a designer and I spent countless hours finding ways to tell stories with technology, finding unusual ways to interact with people, crafting experiences worth remembering.

During the years I found myself working on a lot of different projects, involving a wide range of media and skills: from video-games to projection mapping, from interactive advertising to humanoid robots, I did it all at least once.

So if you ‘re looking for a touch of generative storytelling for your show /event, of if you have this crazy idea that tastes a little bit like magic and science fiction, I may be the right person to make your project real.

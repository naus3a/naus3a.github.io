Aside from developing software and designing interactive experiences, I also dedicate a fair amount of time to education, in the widest possible sense of the term:
<ul>
<li>I teach a generative design class at <a href="http://ied.it">IED</a> in Florence</li>
<li>I contribute to <a href="http://directorsfellows.media.mit.edu/projects/magic-robot-interaction/">academic research</a> any time I can</li>
<li>I speak at conferences</li>
<li>I'm available for private trainings and/or feasibility studies</li>
</ul>

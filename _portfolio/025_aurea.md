<p><strong>what:</strong> Aurea is a performance commissioned by Florim, one of the leading design brands from Italy: mixing dance, experimental projection mapping and interactive software, the show aims to depict the creative process of a designer, using a modern and spectacular performative language.<br />
Using multiple levels of projection and computer vision based tracking, the dancer is able to manipulate glowing objects that seem to float in the air, just in front of the audience.<br />
The visuals and the audio are completely generated in real time, driven by the interaction with the dancer.</p>

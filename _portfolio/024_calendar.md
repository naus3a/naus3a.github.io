<p><strong>for whom:</strong> <a href="http://marcotempest.com" target="new">Marco Tempest</a></p>
<p><strong>when:</strong> 2015</p>
<p><strong>what:</strong> in this performance Marco Tempest drives his audience into a journey through time and the calendar, exploring different storytelling approaches to augmented and mixed reality in the meantime.<br />The software setup we created makes use of a wide range of tracking techniques and visual effects, in order to create a rich and natural interaction framework. During the show Marco uses natural gestures to manipulate digital objects, wears digital masks, moves in a depth-segmented 3D space and is even able to highlight topic moments using a custom designed system of physical, real world lights interacting with the digital world.<br />
In the video below Marco opens the celebration of the first 30 years of the <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/" target="new">MIT Media Lab</a> performing <i>Magic Calendar</i>.</p>

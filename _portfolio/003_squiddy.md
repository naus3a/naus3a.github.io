<p><strong>where does it run:</strong> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphone" target="new">iPhone</a></p>
<p><strong>when:</strong> the app was developed between december 2009 and january 2010</p>
<p><strong>what:</strong> Squiddy is a minimal, digital pet that swims on your iPhone with a unique, primary need: feeding on Pink Thingies. He will not pay attention to you and your fingers poking inside his little world, because he&#8217;s a primitive little predator, not a cute puppy asking for love. This doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t have fun with him: if you give him a few Pink Thingies he will become pretty entertaining (even if in a bloody way :) )&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>how does it work:</strong> it&#8217;s very easy: tapping on the screen you drop a Pink Thingie inside Squiddy&#8217;s world; as soon as the Pink Thingie appears, Squiddy will swim in its direction, attack it and eat it. Pink Thingies aren&#8217;t sentient creatures and can&#8217;t swim around on their own, so, if you want to make Squiddy&#8217;s hunt more challenging, you can rotate and tilt your iphone in order to let the gravity do its job, or your can drag around your Pink Thingie with your finger.<br />Give a look at the video to see Squiddy&#8217;s bad temperament in all its glory.</p>
<p><strong>where to get it:</strong> <a href="itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/squiddy-bloody-mess/id353499006?mt=8" target="new">here</a> or, if you don&#8217;t have itunes, just search for &#8220;squiddy&#8221; on the appstore.</p>

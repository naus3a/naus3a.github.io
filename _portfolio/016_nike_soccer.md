<p><strong>for whom: </strong><a href="http://nike.com" target="new">Nike</a></p>
<p><strong>where: </strong><a href="http://nikeinc.com/news/nikes-my-time-is-now-campaign-comes-to-life-at-the-nike-football-stadium" target="new">Nike Stadium</a>, Warsav</p>
<p><strong>when: </strong>spring 2012</p>
<p><strong>with whom: </strong>I teamed up with <a href="http://onformative.com" target="new">Onformative</a> (project management, co-hacking)</p>
<p><strong>what: </strong>on occasion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2012" target="new">2012 UEFA European Football Championship</a> and as a part of the <i>My Time is Now</i> campaign, Nike created the <a href="http://nikeinc.com/news/nikes-my-time-is-now-campaign-comes-to-life-at-the-nike-football-stadium" target="new">Nike Football Stadium</a> a concept space dedicated to football fans and located inside the <a href="http://zlotetarasy.pl/pl/" target="new">Zlote Tarasy Mall</a>. This space is framed by a massive 30-meter LED screen that, using cameras and computers, can deliver interactive experiences to visitors.<br />
The installation I created invited polish football enthusiasts to emulate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Szcz?sny" target="new">Szczesny</a> and to protect their team&#8217;s goal. When someone standed in front of the screen, a giant image of the polish goal keeper would interrupt the normal animation loop by literally breaking trough it and making it explode in a cloud of 3d glass fragments; these fragments would then rearrange themselves to mirror the shape of the visitor&#8217;s body, following all of his movements. When the visitor would strike the goal keeper&#8217;s pose, the software would take a snapshot of his &#8220;broken glass avatar&#8221; and would share it on the social media.</p>
<p><strong>media: </strong>here is a short screen capture showing how the &#8220;broken glass avatars&#8221; look like:</p>

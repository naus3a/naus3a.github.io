<p><strong>what: </strong> <i>Trails</i> is an interactive installation by George Theonas. This a brief description taken from his website:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A projection is covering the floor of a dark room. When a person enters the projection area they leave a white path behind them. At their exit, the white path is saved, together with its animation. When no one is interacting with the installation, the saved paths start to be drawn on the floor, one after the other, in random order. This automatic replay can be interrupted at any time and new paths can be created and stored. The background colour of the projection is black and the paths white.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I was responsible for bringing the concept to life; the software itself uses a mix of projection mapping, blob tracking and data filtering techniques.

<p><strong>what:</strong> <i>Heroes of New Media (HoNM)</i> is a business game created to support a new media training course for the Oracle marketing guys.<br />
Technically speaking it&#8217;s a multi player browser game developed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript" target="new">as3</a>+<a href="http://www.php.net/" target="new">php</a>+<a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="new">mysql</a> and residing on the corporate training portal. After subscribing to the course, each trainee receives a username and a password, is given the possibility to create a custom avatar and finally logs into the game.<br />
From the gameplay point of view, <i>HoNM</i> is basically an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game" target="new">rpg</a>: the player enters a world divided into several territories, each of which represents one of the subjects he/she will learn during the course. In order to claim these territories and kick away the bad guys, each player has to make his/her character grow stronger: every time a player partecipate in lessons, completes a training unit or accepts and completes a quest (an assignement based on the courseware and to be completed both in the game and/or in the real world), his/her character receive specific skill points that allows him/her to proceed further in the game and receive special badges attesting to his/her achievements.</p>

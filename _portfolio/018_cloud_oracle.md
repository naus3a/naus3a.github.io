<p><strong>what: </strong>during the summer of 2012, I was contacted by the <a href="http://www.oracle.com" target="new">Oracle</a> italian chapter to discuss the possibility to enrich the upcoming <a href="http://www.oracle.com/it/corporate/features/database-12c/index.html" target="new">Oracle 12c</a> launch campaign with generative and interactive contents, in order to create a more immersive experience for the company&#8217;s partners and clients.<br />
After a first phase, where we learned about the company&#8217;s expectations, we studied the campaign&#8217;s language and prototyped different ideas, we finally found the right approach and, at the beginning of spring, we started the development phase.<br />
My contribute to the campaign was articulated into two different steps:<br />
- an interactive invitation in the form of a <b>camera based browser-game</b>, where the user could register at the launch event in playful exotic way; this mini-game worked as a teaser, anticipating the special effects that would be used at the launch events<br />
- an <b>augmented reality presentation environment</b>, that the speakers could use on stage to enrich their slide based presentations: waving their hands in mid-air, they could summon 3D objects on a video wall, interact with them and use them to support their speech.<br />
The visual language and the interaction model used in both steps, were crafted following the campaign guidelines and constantly keeping in mind the contents of the presentation and the campaign&#8217;s claim: <i>Plug into the Cloud!</i>.</p>
<p><strong>media: </strong><a href="http://youtu.be/Af_ENZ7ymag" target="new">here</a> you can find the official footage of the launch event (italian audio); below there is a video of me showing how the presentation software works:</p>

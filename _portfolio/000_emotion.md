<p><strong>for whom:</strong> <a href="http://www.fhnw.ch/homepage">FHNW University</a> and <a href="http://www.kunstmuseumsg.ch/home.html">St.Gallen Art Museum</a></p>
<p><strong>where:</strong> <a href="http://www.kunstmuseumsg.ch/home.html">St.Gallen Art Museum</a></p>
<p><strong>when:</strong> summer 2009</p>
<p><strong>what:</strong> from the project's <a href="http://www.mapping-museum-experience.com/">official page</a>:
<blockquote>Can the pereception of ‘art’ be measured? If yes, how could that be done? This is the central
question at hand that has brought together an international research team from several universities
to test out their ideas within the context of an experimental exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts
St. Gallen (Kunstmuseum St. Gallen), Switzerland.
eMotion – Psychogeographic Museum Cartography is the title of this national research project in
Switzerland, that embarks upon the question as to the measurement of the effects of the Museum
and its modes of display upon the visitor. Funded through the Swiss National Science Foundation
and Ubisense, the fifteen-member research team has combined efforts from various disciplinary
backgrounds, to examine the ‘force-field’ of the Museum – both empirically and experientially.
</blockquote>
My role as an interface designer, was to stitch together the biometric data collected by the database team, in order to give life to animated psychogeographic maps representing the visitors’ experience: using a mix of Processing and pure Java I realized an interactive table where people can represent their own physical and emotional path inside of the museum in a pictorial way.

<p><strong>when: </strong>beginning of 2013</p>
<p><strong>what: </strong>Cybercards is an augmented reality trick that can be performed everywhere, without the need of setting up special hardware, using markers or operating under specific light conditions: Marco just stands in front of a normal HD camera and, using his hands and other improvised objects, he&#8217;s able to control the flight of a set of 3D playing cards.<br />
This flexible interface model was created using a mixture of classic computer vision techniques and modern feature tracking algorithms.

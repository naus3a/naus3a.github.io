<p><strong>with whom: </strong><a href="http://directorsfellows.media.mit.edu/projects/magic-robot-interaction/" target="new">MIT Media Lab</a></p>
<p><strong>for what: </strong>in 2013 Marco Tempest became a <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/people/directors-fellows" target="new">director&#8217;s fellow at MIT Media Lab</a> and, during this collaboration, he started to investigate instinctive ways to interact with robots. This research led to the decision to create a performance where a robot would interact with him in real time and even assist him in doing magical tricks.<br />
Marco acquired a <a href="http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/build-a-bot/baxter-research-robot/" target="new">Baxter robot</a> and, with the help of Media Lab&#8217;s researchers, he modified it with custom manipulators and various special devices.<br />
When the hardware was ready, the robot still needed a software suite capable of handling its new theatrical tasks and that&#8217;s when I jumped into the project. I worked side by side with <a href="http://davidnunez.com/" target="new">David Nu√±ez</a>, Personal Robotics researcher at MIT: he took care of the <a href="http://www.ros.org/" target="new">ROS</a> side of things, while I used <a href="http://openframeworks.cc" target="new">OpenFrameworks</a> to create a toolset that would work both as performance controller and as an authoring environment.<br />
After a few months of work we had a robot that could interact in close proximity with humans, was able to perform magic tricks and could be trained either using a computer or learning from a direct haptic manipulation of its limbs.<br />
Marco named our newborn synthetic creature EDI (Electronic Deceptive Intelligence) and in march 2014 succesfully performed with it on TED&#8217;s stage.</p>

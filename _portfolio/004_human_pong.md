<p><strong>what:</strong> (the Amazing) Human Pong installation was realized in the scope of the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/microsites/decode/" target="new">Decode</a> OF Lab, a generative art event hosted by the Victoria &#038; Albert Museum during which new media artists from all over the world joined their efforts in some kind of generative jam session: we had one day and a half to create from the ground up, under the eyes of visitors, a set of complete installations using <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc" target="new">OpenFrameworks</a>, our immagination and whatever we could our hands on.<br />
Given the impromptu nature of the whole event, I almost immediatly decided to join <a href="www.nerdlabor.de" target="new">Ben</a> on his <i>human pong</i> idea. What we wanted to do was to make an easy and funny experience like the one from the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" target="new">Pong</a> game, even more direct: we wanted that visitors could play Pong using their bodies in a natural, instinctive way, we wanted to take a game that is both a piece of the pop culture and a symbol of the history of the computer age, mix it with some new school technology that still tastes like sci-fi to most people  and create a human/machine interaction where the interface would fit so comfortably that people could use it without instructions, actually forgetting that there even was an interface.<br />
The final result lived up to our expectations: the visitors were charmed by the <i>&#8220;magic&#8221;</i> feeling of the touchless interface (a couple repeated a few times that is was <i>&#8220;ammaaaaazing&#8221;</i>, hence the name we gave to the installation) and lots of kids ad as well as adults spent a good amount of time playing human pong.</p>

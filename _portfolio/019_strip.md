<p><strong>for whom: </strong><a href="http://www.eileencowin.com/" target="new">Eileen Cowin</a></p>
<p><strong>where: </strong>Santa Monica</p>
<p><strong>when: </strong>winter 2013/2014</p>
<p><strong>what: </strong>when I first met Eileen, she was interested in experimenting new ways to make her pieces interactive with their public.<br />
She explained that she was working on strip-shaped compositions, containing images, videos and animation loops, and she needed help with two things. First of all, she wanted her installation to react to the physical presence of visitors; secondly she needed a tool to work on her compositions, allowing her to easily blend different media types and to prototype the final gallery experience in her studio.<br />
I created a software tool that works both as the main app running the installation in the gallery, and as a creative editor. When used in <i>editing mode</i>, it allows the artist to load different medias, adjust their position inside the strip, define interactive behaviours depending on the input received from a depth camera and to adjust the output with some basic projection mapping functionalities; when the artist is satisfied with her composition, she can save her work and turn the application in <i>show mode</i>.<br />
The tool was used to create the installation <a href="https://vimeo.com/89037243" target="new">Time of Useful Consciousness</a>, which is presented in the following video:</p>

<p><strong>for whom:</strong> <a href="http://playhouse.daft.ie/" target="new">Playhouse</a> competition</p>
<p><strong>where: </strong>Dublin, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Hall" target="new">Liberty Hall</a></p>
<p><strong>when: </strong>from 24th september 2009 to 11th october 2009</p>
<p><strong>what: </strong>for  a couple weeks, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Hall" target="new">Liberty Hall</a>, an iconic building located in the centre of Dublin, was turned into a 50 metre, low resolution display, similar to the famous <a href="http://www.blinkenlights.net/" target="new">Blinkenlights</a> project in Berlin: 330 windows, powered by energy efficient LED lights, became giant rgb pixels, ready to broadcast digital art across the city skyline. In order to provide the needed contents, a competition was held and I replied to the call for works.
In those days I really had little time to start and develop a new piece of code, but , in the weeks before, I did play a little with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs" target="new">metaballs</a> and thought I could reuse some of those experiments: metaball algorithms scale nicely to every resolution, are easy to implement in the selected platform (<a href="http://processing.org" target="new">Processing</a>) and, most important, the idea of huge sticky balls, bouncing inside a 50 mt glass box in the middle of Dublin, just sounded fun. So I sat down and created the &#8220;World&#8217;s biggest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_lamp" terget="new">lava lamp</a>&#8220;.</p>
